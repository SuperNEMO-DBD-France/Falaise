Welcome to the Falaise Documentation {#mainpage}
====================================
Falaise is the software system for the SuperNEMO experiment. These
pages document the usage of the core applications, together with guides
on extending their functionality and the full C++ API of the Falaise
extension system.

Getting Started
===============
If you're reading this online and don't yet have an install of Falaise, a
[Quickstart Guide](@ref md_README) is available. Note that at present
Falaise is only supported on POSIX platforms, and even here not all variants are guaranteed to work!

User Guides for Core Applications and Libraries
===============================================
Once you have an install of Falaise, the following pages provide
introductions to using and extending the core applications:

- [FLTags](@ref fltags): guide for using the Falaise's tag registration system for configuration files.
- [FLSimulate](@ref usingflsimulate): guide for using the Geant4 based simulations of the SuperNEMO Demonstrator and Commissioning detector setups.
- [FLReconstruct](@ref usingflreconstruct) guide for using the pipeline application for reading, reconstructing and outputting data generated by the FLSimulate detector simulation.
  - [Data Structures output by FLReconstruct](@ref flreconstructpipelineoutput)
  - [Converting FLReconstruct BRIO Format to ROOT](@ref usingflptd2root)
  - [Customizing the pipeline](@ref writingflreconstructpipelinescripts) for `flreconstruct`.
  - [Writing plugin modules](@ref writingflreconstructmodules) for `flreconstruct`.
  - [Working with Run/Event Data in plugin modules](@ref workingwitheventrecords).
  - [Using Services to access metadata](@ref usingservices).
- [FLVisualize](@ref usingflvisualize) guide for viewing simulated and reconstructed data.

Contributing to Falaise Development
===================================
Contributions to the core of Falaise are welcome. To begin developing,
you should familiarize yourself with the [tools, languages and concepts](@ref developingfalaise)
of its architecture and development model.
