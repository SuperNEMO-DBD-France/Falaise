Introduction to the FLSimulate Output {#flsimulateoutput_introduction}
=====================================

The  current official  simulation application  defines an  output data
model  to  represent  the detector  response  (SuperNEMO  demonstrator
module...).  Each simulated event  record is implemented using the
`datatools::things`  container object to stor dedicated data banks:

- `EH`: **Event Header**, containing generic information such as
   run number, event number and how the data was produced (Monte Carlo
   or real detector)
- `SD`: **Simulated Data**, containing output of the simulation such
  as hits.
- `SDD`: **Simulated Digitized Data**, containing simulated electronic signals (TODO)

Each bank maps to a C++ object that stores data, so the event record may be visualized as a basic mapping:

~~~~
+- Event N (datatools::things)
   +- EH (string) -> snemo::datamodel:event_header (C++ object)
   +- SD (string) -> mctools::simulated_data (C++ object)
~~~~

Here  we describe  the C++ objects comprising the data  model  produced by  the
SuperNEMO Monte-Carlo program.

The EH Bank {#flsimulateoutput_theehbank}
===========

The `EH` bank stores an instance of the `snemo::datamodel::event_header`
class. This is a simple Plain-Old-Data object that holds event metadata,
including:

- Run number
- Event number
- How produced (Simulation or Physical Detector)
- Timestamp
- User defined attributes

In the simulation output, both the timestamp and attributes member are empty,
and are retained for compatibility with real data.

See the `snemo::datamodel::event_header` API guide for further information
on using this class.

The geometry identifier concept {#flsimulateoutput_thegeometryidentifierconcept}
===============================

A very important concept, massively used within the Falaise simulation
and data processing, is the *geometry  identifier* (GID).  A GID is an
object that uniquely identifies a  geometry volume in the experimental
setup.  Given some  dedicated rules,  the description  of the  virtual
geometry of the experiment is able  to associate such an unique GID to
each volumes  of interest  in the geometry  (this technique  is called
*geometry mapping*  and is under  the responsibility of  the *geometry
manager* object and its embedded *GID manager* object).

What is important to  know about any GID object is  that it stores two
kinds of information:

 - the *geometry type*  is an unique positive  integer identifier that
   indicates which type of geometry volume  is addressed by the GID. A
   *geometry  type*   is  conventionaly  associated  to   a  *geometry
   category* which  is an  unique human readable  string (the  list of
   *geometry types  and categories* supported by  a given experimental
   setup  is defined  in  dedicated configuration  files for  geometry
   modelling through the Bayeux/geomtools library).

**To Do** update the table below !

   The  table  below presents  some  official  geometry categories  of
   interest in the SuperNEMO demonstrator geometry:

| Category | Type | Address contents | Description | Example  |
| -------- | ---- | ---------------- | ----------- | -------- |
| `"world"` | `0` | *world* number | Conventionaly identifies the world volume | [0:0] represents the top-level geometry volume |
| `"module"` | `1000` | *module* number | Identifies any detector module | [1000:0] represents the demonstrator module |
| `"source_strip"` | `1102` | *module* and *strip* numbers | Identifies any source foil strip | [1102:0.3] represents the fourth strip in the demonstrator module |
| `"tracker_submodule"` | `1200` | *module* and *side* numbers  | Identifies any tracker submodule | [1200:0.1] represents the French side tracker in the demonstrator module |
| `"tracker_layer"` | `1202` | *module*, *side* and *layer* numbers | Identifies any tracker layer of drift cells | [1202:0.1.8] represents the layer near the wall in the French side tracker |
| `"drift_cell_core"` | `1204` | *module*, *side*, *layer* and *row* numbers | Identifies any tracker drift cell | [1204:0.1.8.112] represents the cell at the French/Tunnel corner of the tracking chamber |
| `"xcalo_block"` | `1232` | *module*, *side*, *wall*, *column* and *row* numbers | Identifies any X-calo block | [1232:0.1.1.0.15] represents the block at the French/Tunnel top corner of the detector |
| `"gveto_block"` | `1252` | *module*, *side*, *wall* and *column* numbers | Identifies any gamma veto block | [1252:0.1.1.15] represents the block at the French/Tunnel top corner of the detector |
| `"calorimeter_block"` | `1302` | *module*, *side*, *column*, *row* and *part* numbers | Identifies any main calorimeter block | [1302:0.1.19.12.1] represents the front part of the scintillator block at the French/Tunnel top corner of the detector |

 - the  *address* of  the GID  is  an ordered  collection of  positive
   integer identifiers that informs about the effective positioning of
   the  volume in  the geometry  hierarchy :  module (only  0 for  the
   demonstrator),  side number  (italian/french), source  strip number
   (from 0 to 35), main calorimeter  column (from 0 to 19), Geiger cell
   layer (from 0 to 8)...

It is thus possible to extract these informations from any GID object.

Example with GID with value [1200:0.1] :
 - Q: What is your type (or category) ?

   A: The GID will respond `1200`  (this is the type associated to the `"tracker_submodule"` geometry category)
 - Q: What is the depth of your address ?

   A: The GID will respond `2` because the full path of
   address is made of two numbers, namely the *module* number (at rank `0`) and the *tracker submodule* number (at rank `1`).
 - Q: What is your address of rank `0` ?

   A: The GID will respond `0` (this is the *module* number, here the demonstrator module is conventionaly numbered `0`).
 - Q: What is your address of rank `1` ?

   A: The GID will respond `1` (this is the French *tracker submodule* number in the geometry convention of the experiment).

The  GID object  is  thus the  unique record  where  to store  the
geometrical   identification  and   localization  of   a  volume   and
particularly for Monte Carlo truth hits.


The  figure  below  illustrates  the  identification  of  the  volumes
traverses by  simulated electron tracks in  the SuperNEMO demonstrator
module:

![Two simulated electron tracks traversing several volumes of the detector associated to various geometry categories.](@ref images/fls_demonstrator_geom_ids_0.jpg)
@latexonly
\includegraphics{fls_demonstrator_geom_ids_0}
@endlatexonly

From this  example, we can  determine the geometry  identifiers (GIDs)
associated to  these volumes,  thanks to  the *mapping*  and *locator*
mechanisms implemented in the geometry modelling manager:
 - The two electrons are emitted from a source strip (green segment on
   the   right).   This   source   strip   volume   belongs   to   the
   `"source_strip"` geometry category (type 1102).  It is the last one
   placed in the source frame.  Its geometry identifier is [1102:0.35]
   with module number 0 and source strip number 35.
 - The first  truth track (bottom)  traverses the drift volumes  of 11
   Geiger  cells (blue  squares)  of which  the  geometry category  is
   `"drift_cell_core"`  (type 1204).  All  the hit  cells  are in  the
   Italian  side of  the demonstrator  module. The  corresponding GIDS
   are:
    - [1204:0.0.0.110] is associated  to the cell close  to the vertex
      represented  by a  small  square  in the  source  foil; the  GID
      address  consists in  module number  O, side  number 0  (Italian
      side), layer number 0 (near the source frame) and row number 110
      (one of the last 9-cells rows on the Tunnel side),
    - [1204:0.0.1.110],
    - [1204:0.0.2.110],
    - [1204:0.0.3.110],
    - [1204:0.0.3.111],
    - [1204:0.0.4.111],
    - [1204:0.0.5.111],
    - [1204:0.0.6.111],
    - [1204:0.0.7.111],
    - [1204:0.0.8.111],
    - [1204:0.0.8.112]  is associated  to  the cell  at  the top  left
      corner of the Italian tracker submodule (in the "C1" C-shape).

   Then the first track terminates in the front part of a scintillator
   block  (category `"calorimeter_block"`)  of the  Italian main  wall
   (left purple rectangle). Its GID is [1302:0.0.19.11.1] which means:
    - module number 0 (demonstrator module),
    - side number 0 (Italian),
    - column number 19  (the last column in the  calorimeter main wall
      on the Tunnel side on the Y axis),
    - row number 11 (not visible here on this X-Y projection),
    - part number 1 (because these  scintillator blocks are modeled in
      two parts, the back part which is an extruded scintillator block
      on the  photomultiplier side  (part number is  0) and  the front
      block which is  a simple scintillator block on  the tracker side
      (part number is 1)).
 - The  second truth  track (top)  traverses  the drift  volumes of  2
   Geiger cells (blue squares) of which the GIDs are:
    - [1204:0.0.0.111] nearest the vertex,
    - [1204:0.0.0.112] nearest the X-calo scintillator block.

   The   track   terminates   in  a   scintillator   block   (category
   `"xcalo_block"`) at the  Tunnel side of the Italian  main wall (top
   purple rectangle).  Its GID is [1232:0.0.1.0.8] which means:
    - module number 0 (demonstrator module),
    - side number 0 (Italian),
    - wall number 1 (Tunnel side on the Y axis),
    - column number 0 (the first column near the source frame on the X
      axis),
    - row number 8 (not visible here on this X-Y projection).

The mctools::base_step_hit class {#flsimulateoutput_mctoolsbasestephitclass}
================================

The Bayeux/mctools Geant4 plugin used by the FLSimulate application is
designed  to generate  collections of  *truth step  hits* through  the
Geant4 simulation engine. The output  data model contains objects that
represents  such  truth  hits. It  uses  the  `mctools::base_step_hit`
class.     The    `mctools::base_step_hit`    class    inherits    the
`geomtools::base_hit` class.

Each object of the `mctools::base_step_hit` class contains:
 - the  unique  identifier of  the  truth  hit,  with respect  to  the
   collection  it   belongs  to   (an  integer,  inherited   from  the
   `geomtools::base_hit` mother class),
 - the  geometry identifier  (GID) of  the  volume where  the hit  was
   generated, if available (a  `geomtools::geom_id` instance, which is
   an attribute of the `geomtools::base_hit` mother class),
 - a    collection    of     optional    auxiliary    properties    (a
   `datatools::properties`     instance,      attribute     of     the
   `geomtools::base_hit` mother class),
 - the  start  position  of  the step  hit  (a  `geomtools::vector_3d`
   instance),
 - the  stop  position  of  the  step  hit  (a  `geomtools::vector_3d`
   instance),
 - the start time of the step hit (a real value in unit of time),
 - the stop time of the step hit (a real value in unit of time),
 - the  start momentum  of  the step  hit  (a real  value  in unit  of
   energy),
 - the stop momentum of the step hit (a real value in unit of energy),
 - the energy deposit along the track segment (a real value in unit of
   energy),
 - the particle name (a character string provided by Geant4).

The recording of these basic attributes is optional. Users are free to
parametrized only a subset of truth  step's attributes to be stored in
the  output  data  model.  This  is  configured  while  combining  the
sensitive  detector  associated  to  some volumes  and  the  step  hit
processor  attached to  the  sensitive detector.  Note  also that  the
meaning and the  need of these attributes may change  depending of the
nature of the sensitive detector.

Note that the collection of auxiliary properties can be used to store,
on user request, additional informations like:
 - the  identifier  of the  corresponding  G4  truth hit  (a  positive
   integer value provided by Geant4),
 - the name of step processor that produced the truth hit (a character
   string),
 - the identifier of  the G4 track (a positive  integer value provided
   by Geant4),
 - the identifier  of the  parent G4 track  (a positive  integer value
   provided by Geant4),
 - the kinetic energy of the particle  at the beginning of the step (a
   real value in unit of energy),
 - the kinetic energy of  the particle at the end of  the step (a real
   value in unit of energy),
 - the  *primary particle*  flag (a  boolean value  set to  `1` for  a
   primary  particle, equivalent  to  parent track  identifier set  to
   `0`),
 - the name of the G4 creator  process (a character string provided by
   Geant4),
 - the name of the G4 creator category (a character string provided by
   Geant4),
 - the *delta-ray from  alpha* flag (a boolean value set  to `1` for a
   low-energy secondary  electron generated along  the track of  an an
   alpha particle, typically  used to compute the  quenching factor in
   some material),
 - the  *entering volume*  flag  (a boolean  value set  to  `1` for  a
   particle entering a volume by Geant4),
 - the  *leaving volume*  flag  (a  boolean value  set  to  `1` for  a
   particle leaving a volume by Geant4),
 - the name of the G4 volume (a character string provided by Geant4),
 - the copy number of the G4 volume (a positive integer value provided
   by Geant4).

Given a collection of such truth  hits, it is expected that users will
be able to apply some arbitrary digitization algorithm.

The mctools::simulated_data class {#flsimulateoutput_mctoolssimulateddata}
=================================

The  `SD` bank  created by  the  simulation within  each event  record
contains a `mctools::simulated_data` object.

Each `mctools::simulated_data` object contains:
 - the primary vertex (a `geomtools::vector_3d` instance),
 - the  primary  generated event  (particle  types  and kinematics,  a
   `genbb::primary_event` instance),
 - a    collection    of     optional    auxiliary    properties    (a
   `datatools::properties` instance),
 - a    dictionary   of    collections    of    shared   handles    to
   `mctools::base_step_hit`  objects.  This  dictionary  owns  several
   collection  of  truth  hits  (eventually  managed  through  *shared
   handles*,                      see                      [here](@ref
   flreconstructpipelineoutput_thesharedhandleconcept)),  depending on
   the  parametrization of  the simulation  output profiles.   For the
   SuperNEMO  demonstrator  using  the  `Basic`  layout,  we  use  the
   following collections of truth hits:
   - `"calo"` : calorimeter truth hits collected from the scintillator
     blocks in the main walls.

     These   hits  are   built  from   G4  raw   truth  hits   by  the
     `calorimeter.hit_processor` step hit backend processor.
   - `"xcalo"`   :  calorimeter   truth   hits   collected  from   the
     scintillator blocks in the X-walls.

     These   hits  are   built  from   G4  raw   truth  hits   by  the
     `xcalorimeter.hit_processor` step hit backend processor.
   - "`gveto"` : calorimeter truth hits  collected from the gamma veto
     scintillator blocks

     These   hits  are   built  from   G4  raw   truth  hits   by  the
     `gveto.hit_processor` step hit backend processor.
   - `"gg"` : Geiger hits collected from the tracker cell drift region
     (considering the Geiger regime).

     These   hits  are   built  from   G4  raw   truth  hits   by  the
     `gg.hit_processor` step hit backend processor.
   - `"__visu.track"`  : raw  truth step  hits collected  from various
     part of the  detector including not onmy  the sensitive detectors
     (scintillator blocks,  Geiger cells) but also  some non-sensitive
     volumes of the geometry (source foil strips...).

     These hits  are built from  G4 raw truth  hits by many  *step hit
     backend processors* of the `mctools::push_all_step_hit_processor`
     class. They are  only generated for specific  output profiles and
     not produced by default.

Each `genbb::primary_event` object contains:
 - the time of the decay (a real value in unit of time),
 - the list of primary particles (`genbb::primary_particle` instances),
 - the name of the event generator (a character string),
 - a collection of auxiliary properties (a `datatools::properties` instance).

Each `genbb::primary_particle` object contains:
 - the type of the particle (an integer value, based on an extended Geant3 nomenclature),
 - the optional PDG particle code (an integer value),
 - the optional label describing the particle (a character string),
 - the optional mass of the particle (a real positive value),
 - the time of emission of the particle (a real value in unit of time),
 - the original momentum of the emitted particle (a `geomtools::vector_3d` instance),
 - the optional vertex from where the particle was emitted (a `geomtools::vector_3d` instance),
 - a collection of auxiliary properties (a `datatools::properties` instance).


The truth calorimeter hits {#flsimulateoutput_truthcalorimeterhits}
==========================

The `"calo"` ,  `"xcalo"` and `"gveto"` collections of  truth hits are
generated  by their  respective backend  step processors  of the  type
`snemo::simulation::calorimeter_step_hit_processor`.

The  principle of  this  algorithm is  to collect  all  raw step  hits
generated by Geant4  in a given scintillator  block (sensitive volume)
and to  build an  unique resulting  truth hit that  sums up  the total
energy deposit along all these  raw steps. The final *calorimeter hit*
records     the     following     attributes     in     the     output
`mctools::base_step_hit`     object    (see     [this    section](@ref
flsimulateoutput_mctoolsbasestephitclass)):
 - the unique identifier of the hit in the collection,
 - the GID  locating the  scintillator block where  the raw  hits were
   produced  (type  is  `1302`  for   main  wall  blocks,  `1232`  for
   X-calorimeter blocks and `1252` for gamma veto blocks),
 - a    collection    of     optional    auxiliary    properties    (a
   `datatools::properties` instance).
 - the first position of the corner of the bounding box that wraps all
   the raw hits (a `geomtools::vector_3d` instance),
 - the second position of the opposite corner of the bounding box that
   wraps all the raw hits (a `geomtools::vector_3d` instance),
 - the first and last timestamp associated to the total energy deposit
   in the block (two real values in unit of time),
 - the total energy deposit (a real value in unit of energy).

The figure  below illustrates how a  calorimeter hit (the red  box) is
built   by   the   `snemo::simulation::calorimeter_step_hit_processor`
processor  from a  collection  of raw  G4 truth  step  hits (in  blue)
traversing a given scintillator block.

![A mctools::base_step_hit object built by the snemo::simulation::calorimeter_step_hit_processor processor for the \"calo\" collection of hits.](@ref images/fls_calorimeter_step_hit_processor_0.jpg)

The truth tracker hits {#flsimulateoutput_truthtrackerhits}
======================


The  `"gg"` collection  of  truth  hits is  generated  by a  dedicated
 backend `snemo::simulation::gg_step_hit_processor` processor.

The  principle of  this  algorithm is  to analyze  all  raw step  hits
generated by  Geant4 in the  fiducial drift  region of a  given Geiger
cell (sensitive volume) and to  randomize the creation of ion/electron
first ionization pairs  along the truth track. The  created truth pair
that  is  located  at  the  nearest position  to  the  anode  wire  is
considered as the  one that triggers the cell, others  truth pairs are
simply  ignored.   The  final  *tracker  hit*  records  the  following
attributes   in  the   output  `mctools::base_step_hit`   object  (see
[this section](@ref flsimulateoutput_mctoolsbasestephitclass)):
 - the unique identifier of the hit in the collection,
 - the GID locating  the Geiger cell where the raw  tracker truth hits
   were produced (geometry type is `1204`),
 - a     collection      of     optional      auxiliary     properties
   (`datatools::properties`), for example the position of the *minimal
   approach position* (MAP) and drift distance of the truth track with
   respect to the anode wire,
 - the  position  of  the  creation of  the  truth  ion/electron  pair
   (`geomtools::vector_3d`),
 - the position  of the impact  of the  Geiger avalanche on  the anode
   wire (`geomtools::vector_3d`),
 - the time of creation of the truth ion/electron pair.

The  figure below  illustrates  how  a tracker  hit  is  built by  the
`snemo::simulation::gg_step_hit_processor` processor from a collection
of raw G4 truth  step hits (in blue) traversing the  drift region of a
given Geiger cell.


![A mctools::base_step_hit object built by the snemo::simulation::gg_step_hit_processor processor for the \"gg\" collection of hits.](@ref images/fls_gg_step_hit_processor_0.jpg)

We can  see that, due to  the randomization of the  electron/ion first
ionization pairs,  the position  of the  truth electron/ion  pair that
triggers the  cell (and thus will  be used for the  track measurement)
does not exactly  matches the minimal approach point  (MAP, in purple)
which is  theoriticaly computed  from the positions  of the  raw truth
step and  the anode  wire.  This will  result in a  small bias  in the
reconstruction  of the  drift  distance during  the calibration  step.
Together with the multiple scattering  of electrons (and positrons) in
the tracking gas  and the time resolution of  the tracker electronics,
this is  a source of experimental  error in the reconstruction  of the
charged particles' trajectories.

An example of simulated event in the SuperNEMO demonstrator {#flsimulateoutput_exampleofsimulatedeventinthesupernemodemonstrator}
===========================================================

The figure  below show a  simulated neutrinoless double beta  decay of
Se-82 from the source foil in the SuperNEMO demonstrator.  The display
of truth tracks, calorimeter hits and tracker hits is activated.

~~~~~~~

We  can  check  that  the  vertex position,  the  nature  and  initial
kinematics of generated particles are stored in the data structure:
 - vertex position  along the  X axis is  -0.0348284 mm  which clearly
   shows that  it lies in  the bulk volume of  one of the  source foil
   strips  (167  micrometers  in  this geometry  setup  used  for  the
   simulation),
 - the  primary  event  contains  the two  electrons  emitted  by  the
   neutrinoless double beta decay of Se-82 (we check that their energy
   sum match the Q value of the decay: 2995 keV).

The name of the event generator (`Se82.0nubb`) is also recorded.

The  bank contains  three collections  of  truth hits  created by  the
backend  processors  of  the  Bayeux/mctools  Geant4  driver  used  in
FLSimulate:
 - The `__visu.tracks`  collection contains 325 truth  Geant4 raw step
   hits collected from all volumes of  interest as defined by the step
   hit  processors that  have  been activated  by  the output  profile
   chosen by the user,
 - The 'calo' collection contains 2 truth calorimeter-like hits,
 - The 'gg' collection contains 26 truth Geiger-like hits.

This result has been obtained by activating the `"all_details"` output
profile.  This illustrates  that  the  `__visu.tracks` collection  may
typically store  one order of magnitude  more raw truth hits  than the
one collected in other collection of hits.
